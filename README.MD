### Technology Used
* **React** (FrontEnd)
   * **Material-UI** - For Icons and prebuilt Components (package)
   * **react-router-dom** - To manage routing between different pages(Homepage, Albumpage)
   * **Redux** - For managing Global States (State management Library)
* **Firebase** - Baas (Backend as a Service)
    * **Firestore** - NoSQL database
    * **Authentication** - Google Authentication
    * **Storage** - Cloud Storage for uploading and saving Images


### To run this on Local machine
* Clone the repo, install all the dependcies from package.json
* Create a firebase project and replace all the Project keys in **'src/firebase.js'**
* Turn on Google Authentication in your firebase authentication console
* Run app by typing `npm start`in command line


### Note
* All the functions which does the database transactions are created in a custom hook and imported into components. Check `src\hooks\useFirestore.js`
* You will have to create Indexes in firestore, as HomePage, AlbumPage uses Nested Queries to fetch data from Firestore. While running the application for first time there will be an error in console stating you to create an Index in Firestore. That Error will provide a link to create an Index in Firestore , you can click on the link and create an Index. (This Error will be solved after that particular Index is created)
